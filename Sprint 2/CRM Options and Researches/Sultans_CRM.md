## Final Recommendation and Takeaway

After evaluating various CRMs based on specific requirements like response selection, availability timing, report production, and contact-specific notes, I find Dynamics 365 to be the best choice for WAMSI's team of 8 members. 

### Why Dynamics 365?

1. **Alignment with Requirements**: It meets all the key criteria the client outlined. From advanced reporting to detailed note-keeping, it is covered.
2. **SharePoint Compatibility**: Given the use of SharePoint, Dynamics 365 offers seamless integration as both are Microsoft products.
3. **SQL Server Synergy**: If we upgrade the database to SQL Server and manage it through SSMS, Dynamics 365 will integrate smoothly due to its native Microsoft ecosystem.

### Takeaway

Opting for Dynamics 365 as our CRM and upgrading the database to SQL Server would provide the client with a comprehensive, integrated solution tailor-fit to their needs.
