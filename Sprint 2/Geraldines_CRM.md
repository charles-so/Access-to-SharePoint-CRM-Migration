# Takeaway
Based on all the CRMs listed, the CRM that is best suited for the client would be Dynamics 365. This is due to the fact that the client has a Microsoft Access database and is in the Microsoft Office suite/ecosystem making any transfer of data more streamlined. Additionally in the long run, if the client wants to take their data further by performing analytics or even creating an app, they can do so easily as their data is already in a compatible Microsoft environment. The only downside is that it is not free or part of an already purchased software by the university. Therefore, an additional subcription is needed.
