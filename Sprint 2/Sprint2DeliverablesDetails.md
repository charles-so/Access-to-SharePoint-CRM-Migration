# Agile Sprint Deliverables and Responsibilities

## What to Deliver by the End of This Sprint?

- Your team should achieve the interim goals set at the end of Sprint 1.
- Demonstrations can be done on the development platform, not necessarily on the Client's choice of hardware.

## Project Retrospective Minutes

Submit minutes of a Project Retrospective meeting in two parts:

### Part 1: Client Feedback
- Demonstrate the project as it currently stands to the Client.
- Record thoughts from both the team and the Client about the system.

### Part 2: Team's Internal Discussion
- Discuss how the project is tracking compared to initial goals.
- Evaluate how you're doing time-wise according to the timesheet.
- Don't worry if estimates are off; discuss discrepancies and learn from them.

## Final Set of Stories

- Create the final set of stories for project completion.
- If ahead of schedule, consider extending the project. If behind, discuss reducing the scope.
- Both scenarios need approval from the Client.

## Group Submission Requirements

- Submit any required documents for Sprint 2 to the Client.
- Email descriptions of new stories to the Client and Project Auditor via MS-Teams.
- Send minutes of both the Client and internal Project Retrospectives to the Project Auditor via MS-Teams (can be combined into one document). Also, send the Client Project Retrospective to the Client.

# Project Retrospective: Data Migration

## Data Migration from On-Premises to Cloud

### What Went Well
- Successful data transfer with no loss of data.
- Minimal downtime during migration.
- Clear and effective stakeholder communication.

### What Didn't Go Well
- Post-migration performance issues.
- Time-consuming data validation process.
- Unplanned additional cloud storage costs.

### Learnings and Action Items
- Implement performance testing before migration.
- Automate data validation process.
- Include a budget buffer for unforeseen costs.

## Migration Between Different Database Systems

### What Went Well
- Zero data corruption.
- Efficient team collaboration and task distribution.
- Effective backup and rollback procedures.

### What Didn't Go Well
- Data type mismatches causing delays.
- Large margin of error in initial time estimates.
- Difficulty in scheduling downtimes for migration.

### Learnings and Action Items
- Conduct pre-analysis of data types and compatibility.
- Employ better time estimation methods.
- Coordinate more closely with operations for scheduling downtimes.
