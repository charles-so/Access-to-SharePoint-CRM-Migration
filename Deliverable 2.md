**Cloud-based CRM is customer relationship management software that is hosted on the CRM provider's servers and accessed by its customers through the internet.

**On-premise CRM, also known as on-site CRM, is purchased and installed on your company's server. Instead of paying a vendor to host all your CRM data, you store customer information on an on-site server that requires a license. Users can only access the data on a desktop application on company grounds
