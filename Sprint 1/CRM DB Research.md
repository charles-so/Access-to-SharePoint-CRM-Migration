# CRM Database Research

## Email Template to be sent to university departments:
To whom this may concern,
 
I hope this email finds you well. My name is Finn and I am a data science and finance student in my final semester at UWA. I am currently conducting a project with another department at the university where I am assisting in migrating their outdated CRM database to a database which is compatible with SharePoint. 
 
Would you be able to assist me with the following:
	1. Details about the current database platform you are using and if it can be used in conjunction with SharePoint
	2. Is there a database platform / system which is currently supported / financed by the university which is open to the various departments?
 
Best regards,

Finn Oâ€™Callaghan [22975893]

## UWA Alumni Database
**Database System:** Rex by Blackbaud CRM <br>
**Alumni opinion on the database:** <br>
* There was a time access was given to the whole UWA to use REX for events but no only the Alumni department uses the database.
* The database stores data of all UWA Alumni, and although it is integrated partly with Callista, it is not in real time.
* At certain times of the year, they are quite isolated from a vendor service point of view (takes a long time to get anything fixed) and the manual data integrations are not dine in time for EDM's.
* The database is not compatible with SharePoint.
* According to the Alumni office: **Callista** is for current and future student and **REX** is for the alumni office.
